## 🚀 Overview

SimulEx is a revolutionary web application that transforms corporate and educational training through immersive, game-based simulations. By combining cutting-edge web technologies with AI-driven adaptivity, SimulEx creates a "future of work" environment where users can develop and demonstrate real-world skills in an engaging, measurable way.

## 🎯 Problem & Opportunity

### The Problem

- **Wrong Hires, Wasted Money**: Companies waste resources on candidates who interview well but perform poorly on the job
- **Fake Skills, No Real Test**: Traditional interviews fail to assess actual job performance capabilities
- **Slow, Inefficient Hiring Process**: Multiple rounds of interviews without meaningful data on candidate abilities
- **No KPI or Proof of Skill**: Lack of objective metrics to evaluate candidate potential

### The Solution

SimulEx addresses these challenges by providing:

- **Immersive, Multi-Role Game World**: A 2.5D office environment with interactive stations for different roles
- **AI-Powered Adaptivity**: Dynamic scenarios that adjust to user performance
- **Real-Time Analytics**: Comprehensive metrics that correlate directly to job performance
- **Authentic Task Simulation**: Embedded tools that mirror actual work environments

## 🔍 Key Features

- **Interactive 2.5D Environment**: Navigate a stylized workspace with different department zones
- **Role-Based Simulations**: Developer, Designer, PM, Data Entry, and AI Engineer stations
- **Embedded Tools**: Terminal emulator, code editor, design canvas, and more
- **Quest System**: Procedurally generated challenges based on role and skill level
- **Performance Analytics**: Real-time feedback and comprehensive skill assessment
- **Adaptive Difficulty**: AI-driven scenario adjustment based on user performance

## 🛠️ Technology Stack

- **Frontend**: Next.js 15.3.2, TypeScript, TailwindCSS
- **Animation**: GSAP, Framer Motion, Three.js, Lottie
- **State Management**: React Context API, Local Storage
- **Deployment**: GitHub Pages (Static Site Generation)

## 🔄 Phased Rollout

### Phase 1: MVP (Current)
Web-based 2.5D simulation game with basic role-based quests and embedded tools
